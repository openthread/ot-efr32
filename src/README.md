This directory contains example platform drivers for the [Silicon Labs EFR32MG][efr32mg] based on [EFR32™ Mighty Gecko Wireless Starter Kit][slwstk6000b] or [Thunderboard™ Sense 2 Sensor-to-Cloud Advanced IoT Development Kit][sltb004a].

[efr32mg]: https://www.silabs.com/support/getting-started/mesh-networking/thread/mighty-gecko
[slwstk6000b]: http://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/wireless/mesh-networking/mighty-gecko-starter-kit
[sltb004a]: https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/thunderboard/thunderboard-sense-two-kit

The example platform drivers are intended to present the minimal code necessary to support OpenThread. [EFR32MG][efr32mg] has rich memory and peripheral resources which can support all OpenThread capabilities.

See [EFR32 Sleepy Demo Example](../examples/sleepy-demo/README.md) for instructions for an example that uses the low-energy modes of the EFR32MG when running as a Sleepy End Device.

## Matching versions

When using this repo to generate a solution that requires two different projects, such as an RCP & OTBR, make sure they are relying on the same OpenThread version to ensure maximum compatibility. You can check which commit this repo relies upon in the "openthread" submodule (in the root of this repo).

If your OTBR project was generated using the Silabs GSDK / Simplicity Studio, we recommend to also use it to generate the RCP project and not this repo. This will mitigate potential incompatibility issues due to mismatched OpenThread versions.

## Prerequisites

<a name="toolchain"/>

### Toolchain

Download and install the [GNU toolchain for ARM Cortex-M][gnu-toolchain].

[gnu-toolchain]: https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm

In a `bash` terminal, follow these instructions to install the GNU toolchain and other dependencies.

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-efr32>
$ ./script/bootstrap
```

### Flashing and debugging tools

Install [Simplicity Studio][simplicity-studio] to flash, debug, and make use of logging features with SEGGER J-Link.

[simplicity-studio]: https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio

Alternatively, the [J-Link][jlink-software-pack] software pack can be used to flash and debug.

<a name="build"/>

## Building examples

Before building example apps, make sure to initialize all submodules. Afterward, the build can be launched using `./script/build`.

To see which platforms are supported, the bash script [`<path-to-ot-efr32>/script/efr32-definitions`](../script/efr32-definitions) has been provided. Once `source`d, the functions `efr32_get_platforms` and `efr32_get_boards` can be used to get lists of available platforms and boards for those platforms

**Example**

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-efr32>
$ source ./script/efr32-definitions
$ efr32_get_platforms
efr32mg1 efr32mg12 efr32mg13 efr32mg21
$ platform="efr32mg12"
$ efr32_get_boards $platform
brd4161a
brd4166a
brd4170a
brd4304a
```

The example below demonstrates how to build for `efr32mg12` on `brd4161a`, but the same command maybe used for other platforms and boards.

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-efr32>
$ git submodule update --init
$ platform="efr32mg12"
$ board="brd4161a"
$ ./script/build $platform -DBOARD=$board
...

[572/572] Linking CXX executable bin/ot-ncp-ftd
+ cd <path-to-ot-efr32>
```

After a successful build, the `elf` files are found in `<path-to-ot-efr32>/build/<platform>/bin`.

```bash
$ ls build/$platform/bin
ot-cli-ftd      ot-cli-mtd      ot-ncp-ftd      ot-ncp-mtd      ot-rcp      sleepy-demo-ftd      sleepy-demo-mtd

```

## Flashing Binaries

Compiled binaries may be flashed onto the EFR32 using various tools from the [J-Link][j-link] software pack. EFR32 Starter kit mainboard integrates an on-board SEGGER J-Link debugger.

### J-Link Commander

Compiled binaries also may be flashed onto the specified EFR32 dev board using [J-Link Commander][j-link-commander].

[j-link-commander]: https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/tools/j-link-commander/

**Example:** Flashing `ot-cli-ftd` to a `efr32mg12` device

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-efr32>
$ source ./script/efr32-definitions
$ platform="efr32mg12"
$ cd <path-to-ot-efr32>/build/$platform/bin
$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O ihex ot-cli-ftd ot-cli-ftd.hex
$ <path-to-JLinkGDBServer>/JLinkExe -device $(efr32_get_jlink_device $platform) -speed 4000 -if SWD -autoconnect 1 -SelectEmuBySN <SerialNo>
$ J-Link>loadfile ot-cli-ftd.hex
$ J-Link>r
$ J-Link>q
```

**Note**: `SerialNo` is J-Link serial number. Use the following command to get the serial number of the connected J-Link.

```bash
$ JLinkExe
```

## Run the example with EFR32 boards

1. Flash two EFR32 boards with the `CLI example` firmware (as shown above).
2. Open terminal to first device `/dev/ttyACM0` (serial port settings: 115200 8-N-1). Type `help` for a list of commands.

   ```bash

   ping
   prefix
   releaserouterid
   rloc16
   route
   routerupgradethreshold
   scan

   > dataset commit active
   Done
   > ifconfig up
   Done
   > thread start
   Done

   wait a couple of seconds...

   > state
   leader
   Done
   ```

4. Open terminal to second device `/dev/ttyACM1` (serial port settings: 115200 8-N-1) and attach it to the Thread network as a Router.

   ```bash
   > dataset networkkey dfd34f0f05cad978ec4e32b0413038ff
   Done
   > dataset commit active
   Done
   > routerselectionjitter 1
   Done
   > ifconfig up
   Done
   > thread start
   Done

   wait a couple of seconds...

   > state
   router
   Done
   ```

5. List all IPv6 addresses of Leader.

   ```bash
   > ipaddr
   fd3d:b50b:f96d:722d:0:ff:fe00:fc00
   fd3d:b50b:f96d:722d:0:ff:fe00:c00

   fe80:0:0:0:6c41:9001:f3d6:4148
   Done
   ```

6. Send an ICMPv6 ping to Leader's Mesh-EID IPv6 address.

   ```bash
   > ping fd3d:b50b:f96d:722d:7a73:bff6:9093:9117
   16 bytes from fd3d:b50b:f96d:722d:558:f56b:d688:799: icmp_seq=1 hlim=64 time=24ms
   ```

## Debugging with J-Link GDB Server

A debug session may be started with [J-LinkGDBServer][jlinkgdbserver].

[jlinkgdbserver]: https://www.segger.com/jlink-gdb-server.html

**Example:** Debugging `ot-cli-ftd` on a `efr32mg12` device

```bash
$ source <path-to-ot-efr32>/script/efr32-definitions
$ platform="efr32mg12"
$ cd <path-to-JLinkGDBServer>
$ sudo ./JLinkGDBServer -if swd -singlerun -device $(efr32_get_jlink_device $platform)
$ cd <path-to-ot-efr32>/build/$platform/bin
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb ot-cli-ftd
$ (gdb) target remote 127.0.0.1:2331
$ (gdb) load
$ (gdb) monitor reset
$ (gdb) c
```

<a name="additional-features"/>

## Additional features

The above example demonstrates basic OpenThread capabilities. Enable more features/roles (e.g. commissioner, joiner, DHCPv6 Server/Client, etc.) by assigning compile-options before compiling.

**Example** Building efr32mg12 for board `brd4161a` with some more features/roles enabled

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-efr32>
$ ./script/build efr32mg12 -DBOARD=brd4161a -DOT_COMMISSIONER=ON -DOT_JOINER=ON -DOT_DHCP6_CLIENT=ON -DOT_DHCP6_SERVER=ON
```
