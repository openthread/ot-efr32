This directory contains example platform drivers for the [Silicon Labs EFR32MG][efr32mg] based on [EFR32™ Mighty Gecko Wireless Starter Kit][slwstk6000b] or [Thunderboard™ Sense 2 Sensor-to-Cloud Advanced IoT Development Kit][sltb004a].

[efr32mg]: https://www.silabs.com/support/getting-started/mesh-networking/thread/mighty-gecko
[slwstk6000b]: http://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/wireless/mesh-networking/mighty-gecko-starter-kit
[sltb004a]: https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/thunderboard/thunderboard-sense-two-kit

The example platform drivers are intended to present the minimal code necessary to support OpenThread. [EFR32MG][efr32mg] has rich memory and peripheral resources which can support all OpenThread capabilities.

See [EFR32 Sleepy Demo Example](../examples/sleepy-demo/README.md) for instructions for an example that uses the low-energy modes of the EFR32MG when running as a Sleepy End Device.

## Matching versions

When using this repo to generate a solution that requires two different projects, such as an RCP & OTBR, make sure they are relying on the same OpenThread version to ensure maximum compatibility. You can check which commit this repo relies upon in the "openthread" submodule (in the root of this repo).

If your OTBR project was generated using the Silabs SiSDK / Simplicity Studio, we recommend to also use it to generate the RCP project and not this repo. This will mitigate potential incompatibility issues due to mismatched OpenThread versions.

## Prerequisites

<a name="toolchain"/>

### Toolchain

Download and install the [GNU toolchain for ARM Cortex-M][gnu-toolchain].

[gnu-toolchain]: https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm

In a `bash` terminal, follow these instructions to install the GNU toolchain and other dependencies.

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-efr32>
$ ./script/bootstrap
```

<a name="flash-debug"/>

### Flashing and debugging tools

Install [Simplicity Studio][simplicity-studio] to flash, debug, and make use of logging features with SEGGER J-Link.

[simplicity-studio]: https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio

Alternatively, the [J-Link][jlink-software-pack] software pack can be used to flash and debug.

[jlink-software-pack]: https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack

<a name="build"/>

## Building examples

Before building example apps, make sure to initialize all submodules. Afterward, the build can be launched using `./script/build`.

**Example**

The example below demonstrates how to build for `efr32mg12` on `brd4161a`, but the same command maybe used for other platforms and boards.

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-efr32>
$ git submodule update --init --recursive .
$ board="brd4161a"
$ ./script/build $board
...
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: <path-to-ot-efr32>/build/<board>
+ [[ -n ot-rcp ot-cli-ftd ot-cli-mtd ot-ncp-ftd ot-ncp-mtd sleepy-demo-ftd sleepy-demo-mtd ]]
+ ninja ot-rcp ot-cli-ftd ot-cli-mtd ot-ncp-ftd ot-ncp-mtd sleepy-demo-ftd sleepy-demo-mtd
[572/572] Linking CXX executable bin/ot-ncp-ftd
+ cd <path-to-ot-efr32>
```

After a successful build, the `elf` files are found in `<path-to-ot-efr32>/build/<board>/bin`.

```bash
$ ls build/$board/bin
ot-cli-ftd      ot-cli-mtd      ot-ncp-ftd      ot-ncp-mtd      ot-rcp      sleepy-demo-ftd      sleepy-demo-mtd
ot-cli-ftd.s37  ot-cli-mtd.s37  ot-ncp-ftd.s37  ot-ncp-mtd.s37  ot-rcp.s37  sleepy-demo-ftd.s37  sleepy-demo-mtd.s37
```

## Flashing Binaries

Compiled binaries may be flashed onto the EFR32 using various tools from the [J-Link][j-link] software pack. EFR32 Starter kit mainboard integrates an on-board SEGGER J-Link debugger.

<a name="simplicity-commander"/>

### Simplicity Commander

Simplicity Commander provides command line and graphical interfaces for J-Link Commander. It's included as part of [Simplicity Studio][simplicity-studio] and is also available as a standalone application

#### Download Links

- [Linux](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/SimplicityCommander-Linux.zip)
- [Mac](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/SimplicityCommander-Mac.zip)
- [Windows](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/SimplicityCommander-Windows.zip)

For Windows and Linux, the Simplicity Commander executable can be found in the location that the package is extracted.
On MacOS, the executable can be found at the following directory:

```bash
$ /Applications/Commander.app/Contents/MacOS
```

#### Commander GUI

Launch the Simplicity Commander executable `commander` at the path stated above to open the Commander GUI, and perform the following steps to flash build artifacts to a target device:

1. In the J-Link Device drop-down list select the serial number of the device to flash.
2. Click the Adapter Connect button.
3. Ensure the Debug Interface drop-down list is set to SWD and click the Target Connect button.
4. Click on the Flash icon on the left side of the window to switch to the flash page.
5. In the Flash MCU pane, enter the path of the `ot-cli-ftd.s37` file or choose the file with the Browse... button.
6. Click the Flash button located under the Browse... button.

#### Commander CLI

The Simplicity Commander CLI provides another method of flashing binaries to a device without opening a GUI.
When using Simplicity Commander in CLI mode, it is highly recommended to add the directory of the executable to your environment's `PATH` variable. This can be done with the following command:

```bash
$ export PATH=$PATH:<path-to-executable-directory>
```

Once the executable is visible from `PATH`, build artifacts can be flashed to the target device with the `flash` command.

**Example:** Flashing `ot-cli-ftd` to a device using its jlink serial number:

```bash
$ commander flash --serialno=<jlink-serial-number> <path-to-build-directory>/ot-cli-ftd.s37
```

**Example:** Flashing `ot-cli-ftd` to a device using its IP address:

```bash
$ commander flash --ip=<target-device-ip-address> <path-to-build-directory>/ot-cli-ftd.s37
```

### J-Link Commander

Compiled binaries also may be flashed onto the specified EFR32 dev board using [J-Link Commander][j-link-commander].

[j-link-commander]: https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/tools/j-link-commander/

**Example:** Flashing `ot-cli-ftd` to a `brd4161a` device

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-efr32>
$ source ./script/efr32-definitions
$ board="brd4161a"
$ cd <path-to-ot-efr32>/build/$board/bin
$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O ihex ot-cli-ftd ot-cli-ftd.hex
$ <path-to-JLinkGDBServer>/JLinkExe -device $(efr32_get_jlink_device $board) -speed 4000 -if SWD -autoconnect 1 -SelectEmuBySN <SerialNo>
$ J-Link>loadfile ot-cli-ftd.hex
$ J-Link>r
$ J-Link>q
```

**Note**: `SerialNo` is J-Link serial number. Use the following command to get the serial number of the connected J-Link.

```bash
$ JLinkExe
```
